  description = {Data Structures and Other Objects Using C++ takes a gentle approach to the data structures course in C++. Providing an early, self-contained review of object-oriented programming and C++, this text gives students a firm grasp of key concepts and allows those experienced in another language to adjust easily. Flexible by design, professors have the option of emphasizing object-oriented programming, covering recursion and sorting early, or accelerating the pace of the course. Finally, a solid foundation in building and using abstract data types is also provided, along with an assortment of advanced topics such as B-trees for project building and graphs.},
